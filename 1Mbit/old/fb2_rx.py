# MUST be run through virtualenv!:
#
# voldy:/home/fireball2/Communications/comsync-r15-port1/python_env/bin/python
#	(or in the folder: python_env/bin/python )
#
#
#
# Handles recieving a new compressed file with either the new image or houskeeping files
# on the GSE during flight and de-compresses them, remains them, and puts them in appropriate
# directories:
#			- Turn receiver on to receive new file: tmp.tar.gz
#			- Close the receiver
#			- De-compress the tar file
#      - IF DE-COMPRESSION FAILS:
#						- Make note in logfile of the time or receiving file and continue
#			- IF DE-COMPRESSION PASSES:
#						- Use size of tar to determine where the files need to go (if < 1 MB, houekeeping file likely)
#						- Place file in correct destination path
#						- IF FILE IS IMAGE: Open image, pull filename from header, and rename file to header.fits
#      - Turn receiver on, wait for next file
#
#
##
### MAJOR CHANGES:
##
#		- Files transmitted are no long compressed!
#		- Files need to be moved now through python os.Popen() command
#		- FITS files are now transmitted as TXT files --> change file extension
