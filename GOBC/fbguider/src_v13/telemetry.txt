What information do we want to send to the ground? 

1. guider status [HIGH]
   -- image number
   -- guider mode
   -- display mode
   -- three camera temperatures

2. Stage positions [MEDIUM]
   -- all 4 stages controlled by guider

3. ADIO status [LOW]
   -- all 8 DIO outputs controlled by guider
   -- all analog IN channels

4. guide target information [HIGH]
   -- sent every N seconds
   -- alpha, delta, theta
   -- N targets, x, y, 

5. star positions [HIGH]
   -- sent once every N seconds
   -- x,y,flux, fwhm, valid

6. astrometry information after a save [LOW]
