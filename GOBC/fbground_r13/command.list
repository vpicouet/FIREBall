This is a list of commands and messages being implemented for the
Fireball guider 2016. Command IDs are subject to change, but some care
needs to be taken, since they are coded on both the ground and flight
sides of the interface.

Generally, any ID < 200 indicates a command being sent from the ground
to the guider, while anything >= 200 are messages sent from the guider
to the ground

## General guider related commands

ID 	 Command description
1	 Reboot guider

2	 Shutdown guider

4	 Set exposure time 
	 -- exposure time [int]

5 	 Tag log 
	 -- tag (string)

### WCS solution related commands (see message 253 as well)

10	 Save stack and solve, including mode
	 -- lost in space/gondola values/uploaded values

11	 Save stack only

12 	 Stack size
	 -- stack size [byte]

13	 Coordinates to use for solution

14	 solution radius


### Physical display commands

20  	 Set display stretch
	 -- min (ushort)
	 -- max (ushort)
	 -- gamma (float)

21	 Reset display stretch 
	
### Indicator display commands

25	 toggle current target display

26	 overlay next target field

27 	 circle guide stars

28	 switch display mode
	 (large vs. small, small only possible when working with
	 small boxes)


## guiding related commands

40 	 change guider mode
	 0: idle
	 1: acquire (equivalent to trapstar)
	 2: multistar fixed
	 3: multistar follow

41	 convert next target to star (dx, dy, dr)
	 take the next target coordinates sent and 
	 convert to next star position

42	 convert next target to stars using latest astrometry output
	 

44	 adjust tracking (dx, dy, dr)
	 rotation around rotation origin happens first
	 
45	 change rotation origin (x,y)

46	 reset rotation origin

47 	 upload target information (BIG MESSAGE, try not to use)
	 x[8], y[8], negative value disables

48	 switch tracking to a different star in the field (x,y)

49 	 load target information
	 -- id (byte)	
	 -- 0 clears 


50	 apply loaded target information

51	 switch sensor to Guider

52	 switch sensor to DTU

53	 upload coordinates for general purpose
	 -- ra, dec (floats)

// 170727 -- matmat
54	 change USE mask

60	 turn on/off auto-focus


## lamp and shutter related commands

80 	turn on TTL X
81	turn off TTL X


### 	stage related commands 

100	home rotary stage

101	move rotary stage to encoder/step position X
	-- position (int)

102 	move rotary stage to a particular mask (this is target dependent!)

103 	set the stage offset (in case there is an offset)

110	home linear stages (do they need to be homed?)

111	move stage N to position X

112	move linear stages to particular position (coordinated)

115	configure rotary stage
	-- velocity, acceleration, etc. 
	-- perhaps automagically done? 

116 	configure linear stages
	-- velocity, acceleration, etc.
	-- perhaps automagically done? 


### Messages from guider to ground

248 	 stage information (gets sent about 0.1 Hz and after a
	 commanded move)
	 -- stage positions
	 -- homed? 
	 
249 	 GPS information (gets sent about 0.1 Hz)
	 -- tbd

250 	 shutter and lamp state (get sent about 0.1 Hz and
	 when something is toggled)	 

251 	 current display mode (gets sent at about 0.1 Hz) 
	 -- stretch, etc.
	 -- full/boxes
	 -- etc. 

252 	 current tracking information (gets sent about 1Hz or so)
	 -- guider mode
	 -- star id, valid
	 -- star x,y,f (pixel coords)
	 -- star tx, ty, tf (pixel coords)
	 -- computed dx, dy, dr 

253	 WCS Solution response
	 Solution sent back 

254	 Message echo  
	 Echo message indicating that a particular command sent from
	 the ground was received by the guider and at least parsed
	 (to ground from guider)

255	 String return message
	 Generally an error message
	 (to ground from guider)
